I'm Lambda Moses, a graduate student at Caltech studying systems biology, and I use R a lot in my research. This blog is about my special interests, namely R programming and dialogues between science and religion. 

#### About the name of the blog
You may wonder, what does "from system to system" mean? One of the "system" signifies systems biology, my field of study. It signifies interdisciplinary thinking, a departure from reductionism, and the future of biomedicine. Another of the "system" signifies the system of religion, which is the governing principle of my life. Which religion do I identify with? I would simply answer God, or monotheism. I used the term "system" because religion is not a list of dos and don'ts; we devote our whole being, as a complex system not only of matter that forms our bodies, but also of abstract concepts of worldview, to God.

Does the first "system" in the blog name mean science or religion? I deliberately left this ambiguous, since science and religion, as least in my life, interact with each other synergistically, or at least they should. Note that religion does NOT influence what inference I can draw from data. I do NOT subscribe to things like Creationism (with capital C) and Intelligent Design (with capital I and D). I do fully accept the theory of evolution AND theism (not deism), but not evolution*ism*, which is when a materialistic worldview masquerades as science. I have [a list of resources on dialogues between science and religion across faiths](/resources/) if you are interested in learning more on this topic or if you still wonder why I don't find science and religion necessarily in conflict. 

#### About my name
"Lambda" is not a legal name, is it? No, it's not. "Lambda Moses" is my pen name, and I'm better known as Lambda than my legal name. Again, it reflects the dialogue between science and religion in my life. "Lambda" is listed first, since my field of study is in science rather than theology. However, the last name usually has more primacy over the first name; "Moses" signifies primacy of God in my life, though it's more like how the constitution relates to other laws. 

But why Lambda instead of Sigma or Pi? That's a bit random and personal. I picked "Lambda" back in high school because my math teacher liked using it. I'm keeping it because first, I'm too lazy to change; second, linear algebra is very important to bioinformatics and eigenvalue is usually denoted by $\lambda$; third, I love R, which is a functional programming language, and it was said that functional programming is built on lambda calculus. 

Why Moses rather than Abraham, Jacob, Joseph, Ezra, Isaiah, et al.? That's also a bit random and personal. I'm not Jewish; I picked "Moses" when I had a special interest in law. For those who are unfamiliar with Abrahamic religions, Moses got the Law, or Torah, revealed by God, on Mount Sinai. "Moses", also because he is the most mentioned prophet in the Quran. I kind of regret that I didn't choose "Abraham", but I'm too lazy to adapt to a new name.
