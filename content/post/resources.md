Here are some resources on dialogues between science and religion across faiths that I found helpful. I have chosen resources that support mainstream science and have intellectual rigor. Note that while these resources all seem to oppose the common belief that science and religion are in essential conflict and cannot be reconciled (a.k.a. the conflict thesis), this does not imply a bias in favor of religion. Historians of science have discredited the conflict thesis in recent decades, though this development have not gone far beyond the academia. In fact, some of the most well-known scholars in this field, who are not fans of the conflict thesis, such as Michael Ruse, Ronald Numbers, and Paul Davies, are not religious.

Christian resources are over-represented, and some of the interfaith resources also seem to have spme Christian slant as Christians seem to write more on this topics than people of other faiths. Honestly, it's much more difficult to find resources on science and religion outside Christian institutions. Why? Here are some of my speculations:

1. The scientific revolution took place in Christian Europe, and today, most of scientific research is done in predominantly Christian countries.
2. Relationships between science and religion, especially when it comes to evolution and age of the universe, are very politicized in the US, among conservative Christians. Meanwhile, in the English speaking world, New Atheism is spreading simplistic accounts of how science disproves religion. As a result, more effort is expended to foster dialogue and correct misunderstandings. 
3. I have talked to some Muslims, Bahais, Hindus, and Sikhs, and asked them about what they think of relationships between science and religion. The answer they gave me is something along the line of "there's no confict". In other words, they don't consider relationships between science and religion a problem[^1]. However, after some scrutiny, it turns out that they do need to think more about science and religion and engage in the dialogue. For instance, it's quite common among Muslim students I met to reject human evolution while accepting evolution of other species. What shall they do facing evidence for human evolution? 

Scholars in science and religion do acknowledge this bias[^2], and would like to invite more non-Christian voices. That said, much of the resources apply across theistic traditions, such as those on topics on methodological naturalism, science and interpretation of scriptures, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence, ethics of genome modification, environmentalism, and problem of natural evil. Moreover, I have only listed English resources here. There may be good resources in other languages.

### Books
#### Interfaith
[The Big Questions in Science and Religion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3359136-the-big-questions-in-science-and-religion) by Keith Ward (Oxford philosopher). This is a thought provoking survey of philosophical perspectives on hot button issues in science and religion.

[Galileo Goes to Jail: And Other Myths about Science and Religion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5543495-galileo-goes-to-jail) edited by Ronald Numbers. This book debunks common myths about science and religion, including, as the title suggests, that Galileo went to jail, by historical evidence. The myths debunks here include both those used to promote atheism and those used to promote Christianity.

[Science vs. Religion: What Scientists Really Think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8044086-science-vs-religion) by Elaine Howard Ecklund (Rice sociologist). This book presents results of sociological research on religious beliefs of scientists in elite universities. It debunks some myths and stereotypes about scientists, such as that all scientists are atheists, and provides some suggestions on dialogue to foster understanding.

[Religion vs. Science: What Religious People Really Think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34371262-religion-vs-science) by Elaine Howard Ecklund. This is a more recent study by Dr. Ecklund involving an online survey and in depth interviews in places of worship. This book debunks myths and stereotypes about religious people in the US, such as that religious people are not interested in science. 

#### Christianity
[The Language of God](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35506.The_Language_of_God) by Francis Collins. This book is not very in depth or philosophical, but is a good and common place to get started. It describes Francis Collins' journey from atheism to Christianity, and it easy to read.

[Monopolizing Knowledge: A Scientist Refutes Religion-Denying, Reason-Destroying Scientists](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13171530-monopolizing-knowledge) by Ian Hutchinson (MIT physicist). This book present resons against scientism, a belief that science is the only valid path to knowledge.

#### Islam
[Islam's Quantum Question: Reconciling Muslim Tradition and Modern Science](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8614056-islam-s-quantum-question) by Nidhal Guessoum (American University of Sharjah astrophysicist). This book summarizes issues unique to relationships between Islam and science, such as Creationism in the Islamic world and development of various strands of "Islamic science" and why they are problematic. 

[Philosophy in the Islamic World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29940298-philosophy-in-the-islamic-world) by Peter Adamson. This is not about science and religion per se, but central issues in science and religion have already been discussed by philosophers before the advent of modern science. Issues discussed in this book are relationships between religion and reason (in both Islam and Judaism), natural theology, and some history of science, with precursors to ideas in the scientific revolution.
