This is to demonstrate how code highlighting doesn't work:

Comments not highlighted properly when I use `message = FALSE`
```{r}
# something
library(ggplot2)
```

The `foo` is moved all the way down here
```{r}
foo <- ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point()
foo
```

Probably this has something to do with `ggplot2`
```{r}
bar <- qplot(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, data = iris)
bar
```

There's nothing wrong in this example:
```{r}
# A proper comment
x <- seq(0,1,0.02)
x
```
