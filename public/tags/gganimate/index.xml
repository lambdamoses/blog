      <description>This quarter, I’m TAing my adviser’s class on computational biology. Though I have taken this class a year ago and got an A, TAing really deepened my understanding of the course material, much of which I have long been using routinely without thinking, such as principal component analysis (PCA).
On the midterm, there was a problem asking students to give an example of 8 points in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) that do not have a unique 1 dimensional principal component projection.</description>

      <description>I have previously written about making the iconic Lorenz attractor animation with plotly; see that previous post for what the Lorenz system is. In the UseR! conference this year, Thomas Lin Pedersen presented the brand new version of gganimate which implements a grammar of animation, much like the grammar of graphics in ggplot2. In the older version by David Robinson, animation was made by adding an aes called frame. Now it’s just like adding geom_*s, scale_*s, stat_*s, and etc.</description>
