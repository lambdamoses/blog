      <description>This is nothing new. Procedures like abortion, germ line gene editing, in vitro fertilization (IVF), pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), and human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research cause quite a bit of discomfort, especially among religious people. On the one hand, the discomfort comes from the destruction of embryos, which are considered human beings, involved in those procedures. On the other hand, many people would say scientists are playing God by meddling with creation of human beings.</description>
