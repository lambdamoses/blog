      <description>I have previously written about making the iconic Lorenz attractor animation with plotly; see that previous post for what the Lorenz system is. In the UseR! conference this year, Thomas Lin Pedersen presented the brand new version of gganimate which implements a grammar of animation, much like the grammar of graphics in ggplot2. In the older version by David Robinson, animation was made by adding an aes called frame. Now it’s just like adding geom_*s, scale_*s, stat_*s, and etc.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in this blog.
## [1] &amp;quot;Hello World!&amp;quot; Once for a class assignment, we were asked to control the Lorenz system. The instructor recommended us to use MATLAB for assignments, but since I’m inexperienced in MATLAB, I decided to use R to do the assignments, and used the package plotly to make interactive 3D plots of phase portraits1 of the Lorenz system.</description>
