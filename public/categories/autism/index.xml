      <description>I have debated for a while whether I should write this post. Eventually I decided to write it, since first, even if it may harm my opportunities of employment after I graduate, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to work with someone who discriminates against autistics anyway because passing as neurotypical is very stressful; I need to reserve my energy for the real cool work. Second, we need to make the positive aspects of autism more well-known to reduce discrimination and increase acceptance.</description>
